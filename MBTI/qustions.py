"Portrait of an ENTJ - Extraverted iNtuitive Thinking Judging (Extraverted Thinking with Introverted Intuition)\n\
													The Executive\n\
\n\
ENTJ's are natural born leaders. They live in a world of possibilities where they see all sorts of challenges to be\n\
surmounted, and they want to be the ones responsible for surmounting them. They have a drive for leadership, which\n\
is well-served by their quickness to grasp complexities, their ability to absorb a large amount of impersonal information\n\
, and their quick and decisive judgments. They are \"take charge\" people.\n\
\n\
ENTJ’s love to interact with people. As Extroverts, they're energized and stimulated primarily externally. There's nothing\n\
more enjoyable and satisfying to the ENTJ than having a lively, challenging conversation. They especially respect people\n\
who are able to stand up to the ENTJ, and argue persuasively for their point of view. There aren't too many people who will\n\
do so, however, because the ENTJ is a very forceful and dynamic presence who has a tremendous amount of self-confidence and\n\
excellent verbal communication skills. Even the most confident individuals may experience moments of self-doubt when debating\n\
a point with an ENTJ.\n\

														The Inspirer\n\
\n\
ENFPs are warm, enthusiastic people, typically very bright and full of potential. They live in the world of\n\
possibilities, and can become very passionate and excited about things. Their enthusiasm lends them the ability\n\
to inspire and motivate others, more so than we see in other types. They can talk their way in or out of anything.\n\
They love life, seeing it as a special gift, and strive to make the most out of it.Project-oriented, they may go\n\
through several different careers during their lifetime.\n\
\n\
ENFPs are basically happy people. They may become unhappy when they are confined to strict schedules or mundane tasks.\n\
Consequently, ENFPs work best in situations where they have a lot of flexibility, and where they can work with people\n\
and ideas. Many go into business for themselves. They have the ability to be quite productive with little supervision,\n\
as long as they are excited about what they're doing.\n\
\n\
Because they are so alert and sensitive, constantly scanning their environments, ENFPs often suffer from muscle tension.\n\
They have a strong need to be independent, and resist being controlled or labeled. They need to maintain control over\n\
themselves, but they do not believe in controlling others. Their dislike of dependence and suppression extends to others\n\
as well as to themselves.\n\
\n\
ENFPs are charming, ingenuous, risk-taking, sensitive, people-oriented individuals with capabilities ranging across a broad\n\
spectrum. They have many gifts which they will use to fulfill themselves and those near them.\n\

"Portrait of an ENTP - Extraverted iNtuitive Thinking Perceiving (Extraverted Intuition with Introverted Thinking)\n\
													The Visionary\n\
\n\
As an ENTP, your primary mode of living is focused externally, where you take things in primarily via your\n\
intuition. Your secondary mode is internal, where you deal with things rationally and logically.\n\
With Extraverted Intuition dominating their personality, the ENTP's primary interest in life is understanding\n\
the world that they live in. Using their intuition to process this information, they are usually extremely\n\
quick and accurate in their ability to size up a situation. With the exception of their ENFP cousin,\n\
the ENTP has a deeper understanding of their environment than any of the other types.\n\
\n\
This ability to intuitively understand people and situations puts the ENTP at a distinct advantage in their lives.\n\
Accordingly, they are quite flexible and adapt well to a wide range of tasks, they are also resourceful when solving problems.\n\
\n\
ENTP's are idea people. Their perceptive abilities cause them to see possibilities everywhere. They get excited\n\
and enthusiastic about their ideas, and are able to spread their enthusiasm to others. In this way, they get the\n\
support that they need to fulfill their visions.\n\
